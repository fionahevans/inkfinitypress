<i>What would you do if your perfect life collapsed?</i>


Leeâ€™s boyfriend dumps her and her new boss makes her life miserable, so she quits. Desperate to find a new purpose in life, she decides to hike the Bibbulmun Track, a thousand kilometre walking trail through the south-west of Western Australia. Her brand-new boots carry her along a wind-swept coastline and through ancient forests, but ultimately Lee is on a journey to self-discovery. 

The Track is a story about how nature and human connection help a young woman find her path. Set along the Bibbulmun Track in the south-west of Western Australia, it pays tribute to the changing beauty of the landscape, its flora and fauna, the diverse characters who live in and visit the area and the language, culture and history of the Noongar Whadjuk people who are the traditional custodians of this country.
