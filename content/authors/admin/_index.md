I am a research scientist with extensive and specialised mathematical and statistical knowledge and skills. I am highly experienced in sourcing, managing, analysing and modelling data from multiple sources, including remotely sensed, spatial and time-series data. I am particularly adept at developing new approaches that combine statistical and process models with machine learning to solve complex problems, predict outcomes and support business decision-making.

<!--
To date, my career has primarily focused on enhancing the assessment, monitoring and productivity of Australiaâ€™s environmental and agricultural resources. With 15 years of recent experience applying analytics to support agriculture, I have an excellent understanding of issues faced by Australian grain growers and experience in delivering results to support the grains industry. I have worked with farmers, grower groups, State government and academia to develop methods for using data collected on and off farms to improve farm business profit and sustainability.
